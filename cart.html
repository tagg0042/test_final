    <h1>Information</h1>
    <p>Betta fish originate in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, where they inhabit shallow waters like rice paddies and streams. Bettas come in various colours, including blue, red, green, purple, and even white. Some have multi-coloured patterns. They are known for their long, flowing fins, which can vary significantly in shape and size. Common types include veil tail, crown tail, and half-moon.</p>

    <p>Temperament: Males are known for their aggressive behaviour towards each other, which is why they should be kept separately. Females can be kept in groups but may also display aggression. Bettas are generally active and curious fish, enjoying swimming and exploring their environment.</p>
      
    <p>A minimum of 5 gallons is recommended for a single betta, with a larger tank providing better water quality and space. the ideal water temp is 76-82°F (24-28°C). A gentle filter is essential, as bettas prefer calm waters. Bettas are carnivorous and thrive on high-quality pellets, frozen or live foods like blood worms, and brine shrimp.</p>
      
    <p>Aquascaping is providing plants (live or silk), hiding spots, and gentle decorations to create a stimulating environment for your fish. Bettas are bubble-nesters, so adding a surface for bubble creation can encourage natural behaviour. Bettas typically live for 3-5 years with proper care, though some can live longer.</p>
