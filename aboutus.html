        <h1>History</h1>
          <p>Simply Betta was founded in 2019 by Sus McKinney, who has always had a deep passion for aquatic life. What started as a small hobby in 
            a home aquarium quickly blossomed into a thriving business as she recognized the growing interest in fish keeping within the community.</p>
            
            <p>Initially located in LA, our first store was a modest space filled with a carefully curated selection of freshwater fish and supplies. As word spread and our customer base grew, we expanded our offerings to include a wider variety of species. This includes koi, double tail, velvet, and crown tail. </p>

      <h1>Reviews</h1>
      <p>"Simply Betta is my go-to place for all things fish! The staff is always friendly and willing to help. They offer a loyalty program, which is a nice bonus. I love the workshops they host on aquarium maintenance too. Highly recommend!"</p>
      <p>"I absolutely love Aquatic Wonders! The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and helped me choose the perfect fish for my first aquarium. They took the time to explain the cycling process and recommended some great plants to go with my betta. The tanks are all clean, and the fish look healthy. I couldn’t be happier with my experience!"</p>
      <p>"Great selection of fish and supplies! I found some rare species that I’ve been searching for. The prices are reasonable, and the store has a nice, welcoming atmosphere. My only complaint is that it can get a bit crowded on weekends. Definitely worth the visit!"</p>
